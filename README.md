pasteb
======

paste bucket in php backed by postgres db and using highlight.js 
from http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/

see it in action http://paste.keentech.tk

be sure to rename pasteb.inc.php.example to pasteb.inc.php and
configure the stuff accordingly

also setup a table according to pasteb.sql, it would make sense
to put the pasteb script in there as id 1

edit the templates however you desire
